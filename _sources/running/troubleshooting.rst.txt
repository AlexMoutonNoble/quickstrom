Troubleshooting
===============

No WebDriver Session
--------------------

If you get the following error when using GeckoDriver (especially after
having successfully run before):

.. code-block:: shell

   quickstrom: user error (E NoSession)

Itâ€™s probably because the WebDriver package in Quickstrom failed to
clean up its session. This is a known bug. To work around it, restart
Geckodriver and rerun your Quickstrom command.
