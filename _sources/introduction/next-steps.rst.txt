Next Steps
==========

We've learned about how Quickstrom checks web applications using
specifications, the basics of the specification language, and we've looked at
a small example. Now, how do you take it further?

More documentation on how to use Quickstrom will be written, including
tutorials and reference manterial. For now, head over to the `example
specifications and webapps
<https://github.com/quickstrom/quickstrom/tree/main/specs>`__ to study
further. Feel free to ask question by contacting `@owickstrom
<https://twitter.com/owickstrom>`__ on Twitter.

When youâ€™re ready to run Quickstrom on your own, see
:doc:`../installation` and :doc:`../running`.
