The Specification Language
==========================

In Quickstrom, the behavior of a web application is specified using a
language based on PureScript. It’s a propositional temporal logic and
functional language, heavily inspired by TLA+ and LTL, most notably
adding web-specific operators.

Like in TLA+, specifications in Quickstrom are based on state machines.
A *behavior* is a finite sequence of states. A *step* is a tuple of two
successive states in a behavior. A specification describes valid
*behaviors* of a web application in terms of valid states and
transitions between states.

As in regular PureScript, every expression evaluates to a *value*. A
*proposition* is a boolean expression in a specification, evaluating to
either ``true`` or ``false``. A specification that accepts *any*
behavior could therefore be:

.. code:: haskell

   module Spec where

   proposition = true

   ... -- more definitions, explained further down

To define a useful specification, though, we need to perform *queries*
and desribe how things change over time (using *temporal operators*).

Queries
-------

Quickstrom provides two ways of querying the DOM in your specification:

-  ``queryAll``
-  ``queryOne``

Both take a CSS selector and a record of element state specifiers, e.g.
attributes or properties that you’re interested in.

For example, the following query finds all buttons, including their text
contents and disabled flags:

.. code:: haskell

   myButtons = queryAll "button" { textContent, disabled }

The type of the above expression is:

::

   Array { textContent :: String, disabled :: Boolean }

You can use regular PureScript function to map, filter, or whatever
you’d like, on the array of button records.

In contrast to ``queryAll`` returning an ``Array``, ``queryOne`` returns
a ``Maybe``.

Temporal Operators
------------------

In Quickstrom specifications, there are two temporal operators:

-  ``next :: forall a. a -> a``
-  ``always :: forall a. a -> a``

They change the *modality* of the sub-expression, i.e. in what state of
the recorded behavior it is evaluated.

Always
~~~~~~

Let’s say we have the following proposition:

.. code:: haskell

   proposition = always (title == Just "Home")

   title = map _.textContent (queryOne "h1" { textContent })

In every observed state the sub-expression must evaluate to ``true`` for
the proposition to be true. In this case, the text content of the ``h1``
must always be “Home”.

Next
~~~~

Let’s modify the previous proposition to describe a state change:

.. code:: haskell

   proposition = always (goToAbout || goToContact || goHome)

   goToAbout = title == Just "Home" && next title == "About"

   goToContact = title == Just "Home" && next title == "Contact"

   goHome = title == title /= "Home" && next title == "Home"

   title = map _.textContent (queryOne "h1" { textContent })

We’re now saying that it’s always the case that one or another *action* is
taken. An action is a boolean expression that uses queries and ``next`` to
describe the current and the next state, i.e. a state transition.

The ``goToAbout``, ``goToContact``, and ``goHome`` actions specify how the
title of the page changes, and the ``proposition`` thus describes the system
as a state machine. It can be visualized as follows:

.. graphviz::

   digraph foo {
     graph [ dpi = 300 ];
     splines=true;
     esep=10;
     size="5";
     rankdir=LR;
     edge [ fontname = "Open Sans" ];
     node [ fontname = "Open Sans Bold", margin = "0.5,0.5" ];

     Home -> About [ label = "goToAbout" ];
     Home -> Contact [ label = "goToContact" ];
     About -> Home [ label = "goHome" ];
     Contact -> Home [ label = "goHome" ];
   }
