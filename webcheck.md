# Introduction

This is a design document for my web testing platform, tentatively named
_WebCheck_. It describes the motivation and design of a temporal logic
used to specify the behavior of web applications. Further, it describes
the design of tools used to check that web applications satisfy such
specifications.

# Temporal Logic of Web Applications

In WebCheck, the behavior of a web application is specified using the
Temporal Logic of Web Applications (TLWA). It\'s a first-order temporal
logic, heavily inspired by TLA+ and LTL, most notably adding
web-specific operators.

Like in TLA+, specifications in TLWA are based on state machines. A
*behavior* is a sequence of states. A *step* is a tuple of two
successive states in a behavior. A specification describes valid
*behaviors* of a web application in terms of valid states and
transitions between states.

In TLWA, a syntactic form is called a *formula*, and every formula
evalutes to a *value*. A *proposition* is a boolean formula, evaluating
to either true or false. Formulae can also evaluate to text, numbers,
sequences, and sets.

## Syntax

-   From propositional logic we have the atoms and the logical
    connectives:

    `true`
    :   is a proposition that is true.

    `false`
    :   is a proposition that is false.

    `not(p)`
    :   negates the proposition `p`.

    `p and q`
    :   is the logical AND, also known as *logical conjunction*, of `p`
        and `q`.

    `p or q`
    :   is the logical OR, also known as *logical disjunction*, of `p`
        and `q`.

    `p => q`
    :   is the logical implication, where `p` implies `q`. This is
        equivalent to `q or not(p)`.

    `p == q`
    : is a proposition which is true if the values of `p` and `q` are
      equal. For propositions it is the same as _logical equivalence_,
      but in TLWA it is more general, as it compares values of any
      supported type.

-   From first-order logic, we have the universal and existential
    quantifiers:

    `forall x in S: p`
    :   is true if for all `x` in the set `S` the proposition `p` holds
        (universal quantification).

    `exists x in S: p`
    :   is true if for at least one `x` in the set `S` the proposition
        `p` holds (existential quantification).

-   The temporal operators affects the temporal mode of a proposition:

    `next(p)`
    :   evalutes to the value of the formula `p` in the *next* state.
        This operator cannot be nested, e.g. `next(next(...))`.

    `always(p)`
    :   is true if the proposition $p$ is true in all future states,
        including the current state.

-   The web-specific operators allows for querying the DOM and the state
    of DOM elements:

    `query(selector)`
    :   is the sequence of all elements in the DOM matching a CSS
        selector.

    `element.text`
    :   is the text content of an element.

    `element.attributes(name)`
    :   is the value of an element\'s attribute named `name`.

    `element.style(name)`
    :   is the computed CSS value named `name` of an element.

    `element.visible`
    :   is true if element is visible.

-   Sets and sequences are defined using literals, and set
    comprehensions allow filtering sequences and sets into new sets:

    `{x1, x2, ..., xN}`
    :   defines a set containing values of the comma-separated forms
        (`x1`, `x2`, and so on).

    `[x1, x2, ..., xN]`
    :   defines a sequence containing values of the comma-separated
        forms (`x1`, `x2`, and so on).

    `{x in S: y}`
    :   defines a set including each `x` in the set `S` where `y` is
        true.
-   Finally, user operators are defined at the top level:
    
    `o(x1, x2, ..., xN) = p`
    : defines the operator `o`, with arguments `x1`, `x2`, and so on,
      to equal `p`. An operator with no arguments can be defined
      without parentheses as `o = p`. Operators cannot be self-recursive or
      mutually recursive.

# Example: Deleting Drafts

In this example, we have a list of drafts that can be deleted. The user
selects one or more drafts, by checking the corresponding checkboxes,
and clicks \"Delete\". A confirmation dialog is shown, and the user can
either cancel or confirm the deletion.

We want to show that when drafts are selected for deletion and the user
has clicked \"Delete\", entering the *confirming* state, the deletion is
either:

1.  *cancelled*, meaning that no drafts are deleted, the same set of
    drafts are selected, and the confirmation dialog is hidden, or
2.  *confirmed*, meaning that the set of selected drafts are deleted
    from the drafts list and that the confirmation dialog is hidden

These are the only two valid actions when in the *confirming* state.

## A Specification using TLWA

The following formula defines the `confirming` state as the existence of
an element `e` returned by querying the current DOM for the CSS selector
\`.confirm\`, that is visible and has the text content \"Are you
sure?\".

``` {.python}
confirming = 
  exists e in query(".confirm"):
    e.visible or e.text == "Are you sure?"
```

We also need the checkbox elements in the DOM:

``` {.python}
checkboxes == query(".drafts input[type=checkbox]")
```

And the checked and unchecked subsets of checkboxes:

``` {.python}
checked = { c in checkboxes : c.property("checked") }

unchecked = { c in checkboxes : not(c.property("checked")) }
```

We can now define the `cancel` action. It says that the set of drafts
(or their checkboxes, rather) are the same in the current and next
state, that the same checkboxes are checked, and that we\'re no longer
confirming in the next state.

``` {.python}
cancel =
    checkboxes == next(checkboxes)
    and checked == next(checked)
    and next(not(confirming))
```

The `confirm` action is the other possibility. It says that the
resulting set of checkboxes is equal to the currently non-checked ones,
and that we\'re no longer confirming in the next state.

``` {.python}
confirm = 
    unchecked == next(checkboxes)
    and next(not(confirming))
```

Finally, we can compose our building blocks to define the safety
property. At all times (`always`), when we\'re confirming the deletion
of selected drafts, we can either cancel or confirm.

``` {.python}
always(confirming => cancel or confirm)
```

That\'s it. We\'ve now specified the safety property of the draft
deletion functionality using TLWA.
