# Running

To check a specification, you must have a running `geckodriver` instance. Run this in a separate tab in your terminal:

```shell
geckodriver 2>&1 > /dev/null
```

Next, run `quickstrom check` and supply the path to the specification file
along with the origin URL (can also be a local file path).

```shell
quickstrom check /path/to/my/specification http://example.com
```

For instance, you can check the TodoMVC React implementation:

```
quickstrom check specs/other/TodoMVC.spec.purs http://todomvc.com/examples/react
```

**NOTE:** Running tests can take a lot of time, especially if there's a
failure and Quickstrom tries to shrink to the minimal failing trace.
Optimizations are due, but for now it's pretty slow.

## No WebDriver Session

If you get the following error:

```
quickstrom: user error (E NoSession)
```

It's probably because the WebDriver package in Quickstrom failed to clean up
its session. This is a known bug. To work around it, restart Geckodriver:

```
geckodriver 2>&1 > /dev/null
```

And rerun your Quickstrom command.

## Help

There are various flags and options for the `quickstrom` executable. Run with
`--help` to learn more.
