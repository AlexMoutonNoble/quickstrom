# Introduction

Quickstrom aims for you to:

- **Reduce testing effort**

  Generate thousands of test cases instead of writing them manually. Lower
  the maintenance burden of your browser testing by writing concise
  specifications with looser coupling to your implementation.

- **Find complex bugs**

  Quickstrom simulates complex and unexpected user behavior using generative
  random testing. When the specification is violated, Quickstrom finds a
  minimal failing example.

- **Understand your system**

  Focus on specifying your system, not on writing test cases. A specification
  lets you run Quickstrom, but can also increase your team's understanding of
  the system.

- **Adopt gradually**

  Quickstrom works with any web application that renders DOM elements. Start
  simple, and gradually refine your specification to increase coverage and
  confidence.

## How It Works

In Quickstrom, a tester writes _specifications_ for web
applications. When _checking_ a specification, the following happens:

1. Quickstrom navigates to the _origin page_, and
   awaits the _readyWhen_ condition, that a specified element is
   present in the DOM.
1. It generates a random sequence of actions to simulate user
   interaction. Many types of actions can be generated, e.g. clicks,
   key presses, focus changes, reloads, navigations.
1. Before each new action is picked, the DOM state is checked to find
   only the actions that are possible to take. For instance, you cannot
   click buttons that are not visible. From that subset, Quickstrom picks
   the next action to take.
1. After each action has been taken, Quickstrom queries and records the
   state of relevant DOM elements. The sequence of observed states is
   called a _behavior_.
1. The specification defines a proposition, a logical formula that
   evaluates to _true_ or _false_, which is used to determine if the
   behavior is _accepted_ or _rejected_.
1. When a rejected behavior is found, Quickstrom _shrinks_ the sequence
   of actions to the _smallest_, _still failing_, behavior. The tester
   is presented with a minimal failing test case.

You might say "This is just property-based testing!" and "I can do
this with state machine testing!" You'd be right, similar tests could
be written using a state machine model, WebDriver, and property-based
testing.

With Quickstrom, however, you don't have to write a model that fully
specifies the behavior of your system! Instead, you describe the most
important state transitions and leave the rest unspecified. You can
gradually adopt Quickstrom and improve your specifications over time.

Furthermore, in problem domains where there's _essential complexity_,
models tend to become as complex. It's often hard to find a naive
implementation for your model, when your modelling a business system
with a myriad of arbitrary rules.

Now, how do you write specifications and propositions? Let's have a
look at the specification language.

## The Quickstrom Specification Language

In Quickstrom, the behavior of a web application is specified using a
language based on PureScript. It's a propositional temporal logic and
functional language, heavily inspired by TLA+ and LTL, most notably adding
web-specific operators.

Like in TLA+, specifications in Quickstrom are based on state machines. A
*behavior* is a finite sequence of states. A *step* is a tuple of two
successive states in a behavior. A specification describes valid
*behaviors* of a web application in terms of valid states and
transitions between states.

As in regular PureScript, every expression evaluates to a *value*. A
*proposition* is a boolean expression in a specification, evaluating to either
`true` or `false`. A specification that accepts _any_ behavior could
therefore be:

```purescript
module Spec where

proposition = true

... -- more definitions, explained further down
```

To define a useful specification, though, we need to perform _queries_ and
desribe how things change over time (using _temporal operators_).

### Queries

Quickstrom provides two ways of querying the DOM in your specification:

* `queryAll`
* `queryOne`

Both take a CSS selector and a record of element state specifiers, e.g.
attributes or properties that you're interested in.

For example, the following query finds all buttons, including their text
contents and disabled flags:

```purescript
myButtons = queryAll "button" { textContent, disabled }
```

The type of the above expression is:

```
Array { textContent :: String, disabled :: Boolean }
```

You can use regular PureScript function to map, filter, or whatever you'd
like, on the array of button records.

In contrast to `queryAll` returning an `Array`, `queryOne` returns a `Maybe`.

### Temporal Operators

In Quickstrom specifications, there are two temporal operators:

* `next :: forall a. a -> a`
* `always :: forall a. a -> a`

They change the _modality_ of the sub-expression, i.e. in what state of the
recorded behavior it is evaluated.

#### Always

Let's say we have the following proposition:

```purescript
proposition = always (title == Just "Home")

title = map _.textContent (queryOne "h1" { textContent })
```

In every observed state the sub-expression must evaluate to `true` for the
proposition to be true. In this case, the text content of the `h1` must
always be "Home".

#### Next

Let's modify the previous proposition to describe a state change:

```purescript
proposition = always (goToAbout || goToContact)

goToAbout = title == Just "Home" && next title == "About"

goToContact = title == Just "Home" && next title == "Contact"

title = map _.textContent (queryOne "h1" { textContent })
```

We're now saying that it's always the case that one or another _action_ is
taken. An action is a boolean expression that uses `next` to describe the
current and the next state, i.e. a state transition.

The `goToAbout` and `goToContact` actions specifies how the title of the page
changes, and the proposition thus describes the system as a state machine.


### Example: Record Player

The following specifies a record player, featuring a button that toggles
between the paused and playing states.

It waits for a DOM element matching the CSS selector .record-player before taking any action.

```purescript
readyWhen = ".record-player"
```

This helper definition finds an optional text for the play/pause button.

```purescript
buttonText =
  map _.textContent (queryOne ".play-pause" { textContent })
```

WebCheck generates click actions for all clickable elements.

```purescript
actions = clicks
```

The proposition describes the correctness of the web application. Here we
start in the paused state, and a valid transition is either play or pause.

```purescript
proposition =
  let playing = buttonText == Just "Pause"
      paused = buttonText == Just "Play"
      play = paused && next playing
      pause = playing && next paused
  in paused && always (play || pause)
```
