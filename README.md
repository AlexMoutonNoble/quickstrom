- **Reduce testing effort**

  Generate thousands of test cases instead of writing them manually. Lower
  the maintenance burden of your browser testing by writing concise
  specifications with looser coupling to your implementation.

- **Find complex bugs**

  Quickstrom simulates complex and unexpected user behavior using generative
  random testing. When the specification is violated, Quickstrom finds a
  minimal failing example.

- **Understand your system**

  Focus on specifying your system, not on writing test cases. A specification
  lets you run Quickstrom, but can also increase your team's understanding of
  the system.

- **Adopt gradually**

  Quickstrom works with any web application that renders DOM elements. Start
  simple, and gradually refine your specification to increase coverage and
  confidence.
